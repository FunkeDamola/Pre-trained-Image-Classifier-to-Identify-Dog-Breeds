# Pre-trained-Image-Classifier-to-Identify-Dog-Breeds

This project was done in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the AWS AI Programming with Python Nanodegree. 

An image classifier was used to classify a given set of images as dogs or not dogs, and identify the breed of the images classfied as dogs. Summary statistics was carried out and the results obtained were compared on three convolutional neural networks (CNN) model architectures to determine which worked best.
